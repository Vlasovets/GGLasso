## Contributing code

The procedure for contributing code is the following:

1. Fork the `GGLasso` repository into your own Github account (recommended: create a new branch for your feature).
2. Install the forked repository **from source** in developer mode (see the sections *Install from source* and *Advanced options* in our `README`).
3. Add your changes and commit them. 
4. Run `pytest gglasso/tests` to see whether all tests are successfull. If you add new functionalities, add unit tests for these.
5. Open a pull request for your feature branch on Github.
